The present dataset contains information on publication fees paid from the budget of Heidelberg University's open access publishing fund for 2015. The fund is part of DFG's Open Access Publishing Programme.  Due to a pre-pay membership with BioMed Central (leading to a discount of 20% on publication fees from this publisher) a few funding applications from 2015 are still pending, because the respective article manuscripts are still under review. Nevertheless the corresponding financial resources were spent already in 2015 in order to top up the BioMed Central membership account. Thus, the present dataset for 2015 is not complete yet. Comprehensive data will be released as soon as possible. For more information please see the fund's website mentioned above.
