## About

These dedicated data sets contain opt-out articles published under the [German DEAL agreements](https://www.projekt-deal.de/about-deal/). While DEAL is a transformative OA agreement, authors remain eligible to opt-out from Open Access when publishing in hybrid DEAL journals. The data format is compatible with the standard [transformative agreeements data file](https://github.com/OpenAPC/openapc-de/blob/master/data/transformative_agreements/transformative_agreements.csv) where the remaining DEAL articles are stored. All data sets are merged in the according [DEAL treemap](https://treemaps.openapc.net/apcdata/deal/).
