## About

This is a dedicated data set containing opt-out articles published under the [German DEAL wiley agreement](https://www.projekt-deal.de/about-deal/). While DEAL is a transformative OA agreement, authors remain eligible to opt-out from Open Access when publishing in hybrid Wiley journals. The data format is compatible with the standard [transformative agreeements data file](https://github.com/OpenAPC/openapc-de/blob/master/data/transformative_agreements/transformative_agreements.csv) where the remaining DEAL articles are stored. Both data sets are merged in the according [DEAL Wiley treemap](https://treemaps.openapc.net/apcdata/deal-wiley/).
