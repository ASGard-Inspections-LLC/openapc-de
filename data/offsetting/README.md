## Offsetting data set

From June 2016 to May 2019 this directory was used to aggregate data on articles published under offsetting deals such as the Springer Compact pilot agreements. 

Its contents have been moved to the [transformative agreements](https://github.com/OpenAPC/openapc-de/tree/master/data/transformative_agreements) directory in June 2019 as incoming data from different agreement types required a more general classification.
