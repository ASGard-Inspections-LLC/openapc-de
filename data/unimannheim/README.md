# APC and PAR data from the University of Mannheim

The reported **APCs** are paid centrally by the Open Access Publishing Fund, which is administrated by the University Library and the Mannheim Centre for European Social Research (MZES). Since 2022 the fund is additionally supported by the German Research Foundation (DFG). In the previous years (2017â€“2021) the publishing fund has been supported by the Ministry of Science, Research and the Arts Baden-WÃ¼rttemberg (MWK).
