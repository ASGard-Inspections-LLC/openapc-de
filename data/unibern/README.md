# OPEN ACCESS FUND OF THE UNIVERSITY OF BERN (SWITZERLAND)

* For invoices from abroad, on which the VAT is not noted, the VAT was added in the amount reported to OpenAPC.
* In case of invoices split with another institution, the total amount was indicated, since according to the OpenAPC page, these institutions do not provide data to OpenAPC (mainly concerns the Inselspital Bern of the Inselgruppe). 
* For publications in journals from BMC, 55.00 EUR admin fees were charged in some cases. These are also included. 
* MDPI: Members of the University of Bern receive a discount of 20%. In some cases author voucher discounts were given instead (discounts can not be cumulated).
* The period column shows the date on which the repayment was initiated by the fund. The applications were all submitted in the second semester of 2021 (with one exception, who was submitted in the first semester of 2021).
