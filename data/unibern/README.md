# OPEN ACCESS FUND OF THE UNIVERSITY OF BERN (SWITZERLAND)

* For invoices from abroad, on which the VAT is not noted, the VAT was refunded, if paid and mentioned by the author/institution
* In case of invoices split with another institution, the total amount was indicated, since according to the OpenAPC page, these institutions do not provide data to OpenAPC (mainly concerns the Inselspital Bern of the Inselgruppe and once Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam).
* For publications in journals from BMC, 55.00 EUR admin fees were charged in some cases. These are also included.
* MDPI: Members of the University of Bern receive a discount of 20%. In some cases author voucher discounts were given instead (discounts can not be cumulated).
* The period column shows the date on which the repayment was made by the fund. The applications were all submitted in the first semester of 2021.
