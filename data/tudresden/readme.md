Note: From 01.07.2018 to 31.12.2018 a pilot project was negotiated between the publishing house MDPI and the SLUB Dresden as university library of the TU Dresden: The SLUB Dresden pays an advance payment calculated on the basis of the forecast publication volume. In return, correspondent authors of the TU Dresden were able to publish free of charge in all journals of the publishing house (more info at http://bit.ly/2O356tJ). This agreement has been extended up to to the end of the 2019 period.
